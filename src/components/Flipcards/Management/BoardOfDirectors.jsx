        &nbsp;&nbsp; Corporate managers are responsible for overseeing corporate cybersecurity strategies by making decisions 
        about cybersecurity investment and shaping cybersecurity policies and practices. The level of management 
        support is vital to ensuring effectiveness of internal audit in improving cybersecurity systems (Steinbart et al., 2018). 
        In this process, IT expertise in the top management team (TMT) plays an important role. Chief executive 
        officers (CEOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs) with IT expertise are more likely to prioritize cybersecurity 
        risk mitigation and identify critical investment to prevent data breaches (Haislip et al., 2021). Some firms also 
        appoint specialized IT executives such as chief information officers (CIOs) or chief technology officers (CTOs), 
        although empirical evidence regarding such posts remains mixed: some researchers find IT executives in the TMT reduce 
        the likelihood of data breaches (Kwon et al., 2013; Haislip et al., 2021), particularly if the IT executives enjoy 
        higher compensation relative to other executives, which could signal a firm's prioritization of IT 
        security (Kwon et al., 2013); however, other contrary evidence shows that firms with a CIO experience 
        increased risk of data breaches (Smith et al., 2021), which may be attributable to the fact that firms 
        facing higher inherent exposure to cyberattacks are more likely to appoint CIOs. There is also inconclusive 
        evidence on whether firing the CIO following a cyberattack affects the likelihood of future breaches: some find 
        evidence of reduced future risk after CIO turnover (Li et al., 2021b), whereas others find no significant 
        change (Say and Vasudeva, 2020). Therefore, the role of IT executives remains to be investigated.
